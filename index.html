					<h3>The next tool for real estate decisions</h3>
                    <p align="justify">Data is becoming increasingly important for many businesses. The amount, the variety and the speed of data that is produced is growing exponentially. At the same time data storage cost and analytical cost are declining. The real estate sector is a non-commodity asset class, but transparency is rapidly increasing. Data is increasingly freely available, for those willing to make the effort. The ‘data cartel’ of larger real estate agents or publishers is broken. Creation of new types of data, such as web-search enquiries, telecom data, tweets, uploaded photos and video is increasing very strongly. We believe that information extracted from new data is now becoming the next real estate decision making tool, alongside classic research, network, experience and intuition.</p>

                    <h3>Analytics become prescriptive</h3>
                    <p align="justify">Companies can benefit from information distilled from internal and external data. KR&A helps to search, identify, classify and ingest relevant data for real estate investment, to make it ripe for analytics. Analytics come in a number of forms but it is useful for real estate to distinguish between descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. These address the following questions: what happened and why, what will or could happen and finally what should a real estate company do to benefit from predictions.</p>

                    <h3>Tenants seem ahead of landlords</h3>
                    <p align="justify">Many of the tenants, in particular the retail, financial services, media and IT sector, are significantly further advanced in data analytics, than property companies or real estate funds. As a result there is often significant asymmetry in information about and from data, when rental contracts are being renegotiated. In the past landlords could compensate with a deeper and better understanding of real estate markets. However, with the significant increase in transparency of the property markets, the balance is moving to the advantage of the better informed tenant. In the Netherlands, where retail turnover numbers 	are kept outside the view of landlords, this information lag is even more important.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                    <h3>Sources of data are broad</h3>
                    <p align="justify">We believe that many sources of data are going to be relevant for the real estate investor. That ranges from data about demographics, national, regional and micro-location consumer behaviour and sentiment, to search analytics and transport data. We use both public and private data for clients. To monitor changes in consumer behaviour, data is crucial. If consumers in certain regions are moving to more of a sharing economy, as some trend watchers are predicting, it can have significant impact on retail turnover. However, relevant real estate data is not limited to client data. Changes in the catchment of a shopping centre or the reputation of a retail anchor all have impact on the absolute and relative return of a property portfolio. We now have the tools to see these changes coming. Average size of a company, structure of the local economy and demographics, number of start-ups, and number of students in an area can all drive demand for office space.</p>

                    <h3>Towards a sustainable data advantage</h3>
                    <p align="justify">Very often the start of a data gathering effort is done via the IT department. We think that data gathering and interpretation are going to be increasingly driven by top-management and move away from the semi-back-office position it may have had in real estate companies. KR&A believe that leading real estate companies will be able to create a competitive advantage from their data and analytics process. Real estate agents data about transactions and intentions of investors and tenants will increasingly be complemented by in-depth analytics. KR&A is able to extract valuable real estate investment information from the new data sources that are springing up around us.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
                	<h3>Higher returns and lower risk through data</h3>
                	<p align="justify">The two most important sources of revenue of a property investor are rental income and capital gains. Both of these will benefit from a strong understanding of new data that has become available. Moving data to the core of the real estate investment process instead of treating it as a ‘nice to have’ will consistently produce higher returns at a given risk level. Or it will consistently decrease risk at a given return threshold. Not every buy/hold decision will be dictated by new data. However, after a number of deals the better informed investors will start to outperform the traditional old school investor, that deals merely on the basis of network, experience, intuition and classic broker research.</p>
